[Mighty](https://www.mightyapp.com/) made a big splash recently with their [HN launch](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26957215).

Most commentators seem to be focusing on CPU / RAM savings as the pros and input latency / pricing as the cons. I find Mighty to be interesting for a different reason.

I think *Mighty might work because of the effect of latency on networking round trips*.

Most modern web based systems talk a lot and exchange messages based on the information they received from prior communications. Examples of this are:
* TCP + TLS handshakes
* websites loading stylesheets and scripts after the main document loads

Latency in and of itself is not a bad thing. *Latency + round trips is what's slowing everything down.*

Streaming technology is free from these problems. There's no round trips â€” streaming server just sends a video stream to the user. If you put Mighty streaming servers close to popular web services you massively decrease the amount of latency introduced by the round trips.

<i>In this example the resulting latency is 90ms vs 360ms for the "standard" setup.<br> And that's only with 3 round trips</i>

I could see a future in which Mighty becomes a client for a network of Mighty-enabled websites where instead of an HTTPS load balancer you put a video-streaming (Mighty?) server in front of your backend.
