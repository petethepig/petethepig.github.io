I'm originally from St Petersburg, Russia, now living in Oakland, CA. I'm an Engineering&nbsp;Team&nbsp;Lead at [Sensor&nbsp;Tower](https://sensortower.com/).

My favorite areas of software engineering are distributed systems, performance analysis, monitoring, networking. I like building things. Check out my [projects](/projects).

My email is [@]([me-email]) — drop me a line sometime.
